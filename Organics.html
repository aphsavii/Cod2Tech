            <h2>What is organic farming?</h2>
            <p>
                There are many explanations and definitions for organic agriculture but all converge to state that it is
                a system that relies on ecosystem management rather than external agricultural inputs. It is a system
                that begins to consider potential environmental and social impacts by eliminating the use of synthetic
                inputs, such as synthetic fertilizers and pesticides, veterinary drugs, genetically modified seeds and
                breeds, preservatives, additives and irradiation. These are replaced with site-specific management
                practices that maintain and increase long-term soil fertility and prevent pest and diseases. <br>

                "Organic agriculture is a holistic production management system which promotes and enhances
                agro-ecosystem health, including biodiversity, biological cycles, and soil biological activity. It
                emphasises the use of management practices in preference to the use of off-farm inputs, taking into
                account that regional conditions require locally adapted systems. This is accomplished by using, where
                possible, agronomic, biological, and mechanical methods, as opposed to using synthetic materials, to
                fulfil any specific function within the system." (FAO/WHO Codex Alimentarius Commission, 1999).<br>

                Organic agriculture systems and products are not always certified and are referred to as "non-certified
                organic agriculture or products". This excludes agriculture systems that do not use synthetic inputs by
                default (e.g. systems that lack soil building practices and degrade land). Three different driving
                forces can be identified for organic agriculture:<br><br>
                Consumer or market-driven organic agriculture. Products are clearly identified through certification and
                labelling. Consumers take a conscious decision on how their food is produced, processed, handled and
                marketed. The consumer therefore has a strong influence over organic production.<br><br>
                Service-driven organic agriculture. In countries such as in the European Union (EU), subsidies for
                organic agriculture are available to generate environmental goods and services, such as reducing
                groundwater pollution or creating a more biologically diverse landscape.<br><br>
                Farmer-driven organic agriculture. Some farmers believe that conventional agriculture is unsustainable
                and have developed alternative modes of production to improve their family health, farm economies and/or
                self-reliance. In many developing countries, organic agriculture is adopted as a method to improve
                household food security or to achieve a reduction of input costs. Produce is not necessarily sold on the
                market or is sold without a price distinction as it is not certified. In developed countries, small
                farmers are increasingly developing direct channels to deliver non-certified organic produce to
                consumers. In the United States of America (USA), farmers marketing small quantities of organic products
                are formally exempt from certification.

            <h2>What are the environmental benefits of organic farming?</h2>
            <p>
                Sustainability over the long term : Many changes observed in the environment are long term, occurring
                slowly over time. Organic agriculture considers the medium- and long-term effect of agricultural
                interventions on the agro-ecosystem. It aims to produce food while establishing an ecological balance to
                prevent soil fertility or pest problems. Organic agriculture takes a proactive approach as opposed to
                treating problems after they emerge.<br><br>
                Soil : Soil building practices such as crop rotations, inter-cropping, symbiotic associations, cover
                crops, organic fertilizers and minimum tillage are central to organic practices. These encourage soil
                fauna and flora, improving soil formation and structure and creating more stable systems. In turn,
                nutrient and energy cycling is increased and the retentive abilities of the soil for nutrients and water
                are enhanced, compensating for the non-use of mineral fertilizers. Such management techniques also play
                an important role in soil erosion control. The length of time that the soil is exposed to erosive forces
                is decreased, soil biodiversity is increased, and nutrient losses are reduced, helping to maintain and
                enhance soil productivity. Crop export of nutrients is usually compensated by farm-derived renewable
                resources but it is sometimes necessary to supplement organic soils with potassium, phosphate, calcium,
                magnesium and trace elements from external sources.<br><br>
                Water : In many agriculture areas, pollution of groundwater courses with synthetic fertilizers and
                pesticides is a major problem. As the use of these is prohibited in organic agriculture, they are
                replaced by organic fertilizers (e.g. compost, animal manure, green manure) and through the use of
                greater biodiversity (in terms of species cultivated and permanent vegetation), enhancing soil structure
                and water infiltration. Well managed organic systems with better nutrient retentive abilities, greatly
                reduce the risk of groundwater pollution. In some areas where pollution is a real problem, conversion to
                organic agriculture is highly encouraged as a restorative measure (e.g. by the Governments of France and
                Germany).<br><br>
                Air and climate change : Organic agriculture reduces non-renewable energy use by decreasing agrochemical
                needs (these require high quantities of fossil fuel to be produced). Organic agriculture contributes to
                mitigating the greenhouse effect and global warming through its ability to sequester carbon in the soil.
                Many management practices used by organic agriculture (e.g. minimum tillage, returning crop residues to
                the soil, the use of cover crops and rotations, and the greater integration of nitrogen-fixing legumes),
                increase the return of carbon to the soil, raising productivity and favouring carbon storage. A number
                of studies revealed that soil organic carbon contents under organic farming are considerably higher. The
                more organic carbon is retained in the soil, the more the mitigation potential of agriculture against
                climate change is higher. However, there is much research needed in this field, yet. There is a lack of
                data on soil organic carbon for developing countries, with no farm system comparison data from Africa
                and Latin America, and only limited data on soil organic carbon stocks, which is crucial for determining
                carbon sequestration rates for farming practices.<br><br>
                Biodiversity : Organic farmers are both custodians and users of biodiversity at all levels. At the gene
                level, traditional and adapted seeds and breeds are preferred for their greater resistance to diseases
                and their resilience to climatic stress. At the species level, diverse combinations of plants and
                animals optimize nutrient and energy cycling for agricultural production. At the ecosystem level, the
                maintenance of natural areas within and around organic fields and absence of chemical inputs create
                suitable habitats for wildlife. The frequent use of under-utilized species (often as rotation crops to
                build soil fertility) reduces erosion of agro-biodiversity, creating a healthier gene pool - the basis
                for future adaptation. The provision of structures providing food and shelter, and the lack of pesticide
                use, attract new or re-colonizing species to the organic area (both permanent and migratory), including
                wild flora and fauna (e.g. birds) and organisms beneficial to the organic system such as pollinators and
                pest predators. The number of studies on organic farming and biodiversity increased significantly within
                the last years.

            <h2>Can organic farmers produce enough food for everybody?</h2>
            <p>
                Organic farmers can produce enough food to feed everyone, but it may require some changes in
                agricultural practices and consumer behavior.

                Organic farming relies on sustainable practices that emphasize soil health, crop rotation, and natural
                pest management. While yields can be lower compared to conventional farming methods, research has shown
                that organic farming can be just as productive as conventional methods in some cases, especially when it
                comes to producing crops like fruits, vegetables, and legumes.

                However, organic farming can face challenges such as the availability of land, the cost of inputs and
                labor, and the difficulty of scaling up production to meet growing demand. Additionally, organic farming
                may not be suitable for all regions or types of crops.

                To meet global demand for food sustainably, a combination of different agricultural methods may be
                necessary. This could include a mix of organic and conventional farming, agroforestry, and other
                sustainable agricultural practices. It may also require reducing food waste, improving distribution
                systems, and changing diets to prioritize plant-based foods.

                In summary, organic farming can be a viable method of producing food, but it may require changes in both
                agricultural practices and consumer behavior to feed everyone sustainably.

            <h2>Why is organic food more expensive than conventional food?</h2>
            <p>
                Organic food is often more expensive than conventional food for several reasons:
            <div>
                <ul>Production costs: Organic farming practices can be more labor-intensive and require more resources,
                    such as compost, cover crops, and natural pest management techniques, which can increase production
                    costs.</ul>
                <ul>Certification costs: Organic farms need to be certified by accredited agencies to ensure that they
                    comply with organic standards. This process can be costly for farmers, and these costs are often
                    passed on to consumers.</ul>
                <ul>Lower yields: Organic farming can result in lower yields compared to conventional farming methods.
                    This means that organic farmers may need to charge more per unit of produce to cover their costs.
                </ul>
                <ul>Supply and demand: Organic food is often produced in smaller quantities and can be in high demand,
                    which can drive up prices.</ul>
                <ul>Transportation and storage: Organic food may require more careful handling during transportation and
                    storage to maintain its quality, which can add to its cost.</ul>
                <ul>Consumer willingness to pay: Studies have shown that consumers are often willing to pay a premium
                    for organic food due to perceived health and environmental benefits.</ul>
                </li>
                Overall, the higher cost of organic food reflects the added value of organic farming practices and the
                demand for organic products. As organic farming practices become more widespread and efficient, and as
                demand for organic food grows, the price of organic food may become more competitive with conventional
                food.
